## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 6 phases following natural dependency chain (INFRA -> HOOK -> WFLOW -> FEED -> INST -> TRANS)
- Roadmap: Phase 5 (Installation) placed after Phase 4 (not after Phase 2) because installer should ship the complete system
- Roadmap: Plan count preliminary at 13 total (3+2+2+3+1+2), refined during planning
- [Phase 01]: Telemetry enabled by default (treats missing config as enabled) for zero-friction adoption
- [Phase 01]: Event envelope uses v:1 field for future schema evolution
